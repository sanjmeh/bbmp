# BBMP
Code to process BBMP data
The set of R codes are written specifically to process BBMP projects data, expense data or receipts data as obtained from the IFMS.
The code may not run directly on cloning as it depends on certain .RData files that will be available to authorised people.
Please contact me in case you are interested to contribute to the project.
